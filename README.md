- Note: Important Note: This project is specifically configured to operate on the route /[author]/[repo]/. Please note that there is no home page set up for this application.

Open [http://localhost:3000/vercel/next.js](http://localhost:3000/vercel/next.js) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
