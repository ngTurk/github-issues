In the test case I found, the suspended parent is blocking an unrelated sibling Suspense tree from rendering.\r\n\r\nSee the test case I wrote for a detailed step-by-step explanation.\r\n\r\nThis is arguably an esoteric issue because the parent component's data should be cached. However, even if the data is cached, loading the data from cache can still be async. It's a known part of the design that this creates a (short-lived) waterfall along the parent path of the dynamic slot ‚Äî but in principle, we should avoid waterfalls between parallel Suspense trees.\r\n\r\nI suspect it's some small quirk of the implementation that can be fixed without much trouble.",
